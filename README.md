# my-twitter-server

Because of restrictions on Twitter's API usage, client-side applications cannot access the Twitter API. This project
provides the structure for a server-side Node application that can handle incoming requests and modify responses
from Twitter's API internally so that only essential information is ever delivered to client-side applications.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```
